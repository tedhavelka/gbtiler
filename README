GBTILER VERSION 2.0

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

Gbtiler is a program that can offset and merge gerber and NC drill files 
that represent circuit board artwork. This program is written in perl 
and licensed under the GNU public license. This is the latest release
of version 2.0.

By using gbtiler, common layers from multiple circuit boards may be merged
and offset into one or more large files, each holding a layer of the combined
board artwork. Gbtiler 2.0 processes gerber Cartesian data and gerber arc 
statements, and NC drill file data. Both RS274X gerber and NC drill languages, 
however, offer a rich set of plotting and drilling directives. Gbtiler doesn't 
handle all or even most of the more complex, obscure gerber and drill statements. 

HOW TO USE GBTILER 2.0

Setting up gbtiler 2.0
  For information on installing gbtiler2, see the INSTALL file included in
  the distribution.  For other documentation, see the gbtiler.pod file.

you can invoke gbtiler with the following line,  

   gbtiler --argfile ../examples/test-args--relay-and-icd.txt

After running gbtiler both temporary files and final tiled files are written 
to a directory named 'workspace'. This directory is not part of the 2.0 release, 
but is created when gbtiler doesn't find it and has permission to do so. 
Then you can view the result of gbtiler in gerber viewer.

The general things a user must specify to gbtiler include,  

    * source gerber and/or drill files and their locations,
    * offset values to position tiled files,
    * some formatting information to format the output file,
    * name of output file,
