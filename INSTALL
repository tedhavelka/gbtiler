AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

A. DECOMPRESS

    Decompress the file with gzip -d gbtiler2.tar.gz
    You can get gzip from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu.

    Or, you can combine this step with the next to save disk space:

    gzip -dc gbtiler2.tar.gz | tar -xof - 

B. UNPACK

    Unpack the result with tar -xof gbtiler2.tar 

C. BUILD

    Go into the newly-created directory and type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make

D. INSTALL

    While still in that directory, type:

    make install

    Make sure you have the appropriate permissions to install the module in your Perl 5 library directory. 
Often, you'll need to be root.

    That's all you need to do on Unix systems with dynamic linking. Most Unix systems have dynamic 
linking -- if yours doesn't, or if for another reason you have a statically-linked perl, and the 
module requires compilation, you'll need to build a new Perl binary that includes the module. 
Again, you'll probably need to be root. 


In our installation, I have installed required modules in:
        /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/
